# Detecting-Parkinsons-Disease
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's disease based on nocturnal breathing patterns. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed to predict the presence of Parkinson's with an accuracy of 89.74%.

**Features**

**SVM Classifier**: Used for binary classification of Parkinson's disease based on input features.

**Data Preprocessing**: Standardization and feature extraction from breathing patterns.

**High Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of 89.74% on the testing dataset.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project includes breathing signal data from patients and healthy individuals. Data was sourced from publicly available medical repositories.
